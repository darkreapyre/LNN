# Lambda Neural Network
>**Note:** Work in progress
## Overview
This repository comtains various branches that depict leveraging AWS Lambda Functions as Neurons for various Neural Networks. The objective to learn how to build Deep Neural Networks from scratch without leveraging frameworks like TensorFlow, Caffe, Theano etc. 

Each version is mean to enhance the functionality of the implementation to start from a basic Perceptron and evolve into more compleicated funcitonality that includes Regularization, Optmization and Gradient Checking techniques as well as deeper network architectures. The version branches are as follows:

- Version 1.0: Single Neuron Logistic Regression
- Version 1.1: Leveraging other sources for numpy array storage
- Version 2.0: Single Hidden Layer Logistic Regression
- Version 3.0: Deep Neural Network
- Version 4.0: Optimization

The various versions are loosely based on the [deepelarning.ai](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) Coursera specialization.
